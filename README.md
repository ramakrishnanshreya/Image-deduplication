# Image-deduplication
This repository provides an end-to-end pipeline for detecting and removing duplicate or near-duplicate images from a dataset. Duplicate images can degrade the performance of computer vision models, waste storage, and introduce bias. This project helps identify such duplicates using efficient similarity techniques.
